A well-tested Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation in Python with a CLI interface and AI opponent.

---

## Features

* Interactive command-line interface
* AI opponent with multiple difficulty levels
* Human vs Human gameplay
* Smart AI using minimax algorithm
* Comprehensive test suite with >95% coverage
* Modern Python development setup with pre-commit hooks
* Proper package structure and configuration

---

## Installation

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install tictactoe-vish
```

### From Docker Hub

```bash
# Run directly
docker run -it vishwas/tic-tac-toe:latest

# Or pull first
docker pull vishwas/tic-tac-toe:latest
docker run -it vishwas/tic-tac-toe:latest
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/v-s-v-i-s-h-w-a-s/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
pip install -e .[dev]
```

---

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Run the game (if installed via pip)
tictactoe

# Show help
tictactoe --help

# Show version
tictactoe --version

# Or if installed in development mode
python -m src.tictactoe.cli
```

### As a Library

```python
from tictactoe import Board, AIPlayer

# Create a game
board = Board()
ai = AIPlayer(difficulty="hard")

# Make moves
board.make_move(1, 1)  # Human move to center
ai_move = ai.get_best_move(board)  # AI calculates best move
board.make_move(ai_move[0], ai_move[1])  # AI makes move

# Check game state
if board.check_winner():
    print(f"Winner: {board.check_winner()}")
elif board.is_full():
    print("It's a tie!")
```

## Game Rules

* Players take turns placing X's and O's on a 3x3 grid
* First player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins
* If the grid fills up with no winner, it's a tie
* Positions are specified as row,col coordinates (0-2 for each)

---

## AI Difficulty Levels

* **Easy**: Random moves
* **Medium**: Blocks opponent wins and takes available wins
* **Hard**: Uses minimax algorithm for optimal play

## Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/v-s-v-i-s-h-w-a-s/tic-tac-toe.git
cd tic-tac-toe
pip install -e .[dev]

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=src/tictactoe --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_board.py
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
black src tests

# Sort imports
isort src tests

# Lint code
flake8 src tests
pylint src

# Run all pre-commit hooks
pre-commit run --all-files
```
