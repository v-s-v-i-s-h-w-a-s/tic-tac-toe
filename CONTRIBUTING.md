## ü§ù How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- üêõ **Bug fixes**
- ‚ú® **New features**
- üìù **Documentation improvements**
- üß™ **Test additions**
- üé® **Code refactoring**
- üîß **CI/CD improvements**

### Before You Start

1. **Check existing issues** and pull requests to avoid duplication
2. **Open an issue** for new features or major changes to discuss the approach
3. **Start with small contributions** if you're new to the project

## üîÑ Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your local main branch
git checkout main
git pull upstream main

# Create a new feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# OR for bug fixes
git checkout -b fix/bug-description
```

### 2. Make Your Changes

- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the existing code style
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=html

# Run specific tests
pytest tests/test_board.py

# Check code quality
black src/ tests/
isort src/ tests/
flake8 src/ tests/
pylint src/
```

### 4. Commit Your Changes

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```bash
# Good commit messages
git commit -m "feat: add multiplayer support"
git commit -m "fix: resolve AI move calculation bug"
git commit -m "docs: update installation instructions"
git commit -m "test: add board validation tests"
```

### 5. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
# Push your branch
git push origin feature/your-feature-name

# Create a pull request on GitHub
```

## üé® Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- **Use Black** for code formatting (automatic with pre-commit)
- **Use isort** for import sorting (automatic with pre-commit)
- **Follow PEP 8** guidelines
- **Use type hints** for all function parameters and return values
- **Write docstrings** for all public functions and classes

### Example

```python
def calculate_score(board: Board, player: str) -> int:
    """Calculate the score for a given player on the board.
    
    Args:
        board: The game board to evaluate
        player: The player symbol ('X' or 'O')
        
    Returns:
        The calculated score for the player
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If player is not 'X' or 'O'
    """
    if player not in ['X', 'O']:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid player: {player}")
    
    return board.get_score(player)
```

### Documentation Style

- Use **Markdown** for documentation files
- Include **code examples** where helpful
- Keep **line length** under 100 characters
- Use **emoji** sparingly and consistently

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

- **Write tests** for all new functionality
- **Update tests** when modifying existing code
- **Use descriptive test names**
- **Follow the AAA pattern**: Arrange, Act, Assert

### Test Structure

```python
def test_board_make_move_valid_position():
    """Test that making a move on a valid position works correctly."""
    # Arrange
    board = Board()
    
    # Act
    result = board.make_move(0, 0, 'X')
    
    # Assert
    assert result is True
    assert board.get_cell(0, 0) == 'X'
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Maintain **>95% test coverage**
- All new code must be covered by tests
- Integration tests for CLI functionality
